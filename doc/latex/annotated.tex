\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\-:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classkia_1_1Mesh}{kia\-::\-Mesh} \\*The \char`\"{}\-Mesh\char`\"{} class is the master class for the S\-T\-L meshes. It includes the original user input mesh, methods to load this and subdivide it into a finer stl mesh. The subdivision does not alter the overall geometry, this is not a smoothing utility. It is also important to note that the exact size of the final triangles is undefined, only the maximum triangle size is specified }{\pageref{classkia_1_1Mesh}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classkia_1_1Triangle}{kia\-::\-Triangle} \\*The \char`\"{}\-Triangle\char`\"{} class defines exactly 1 triangle as used by an S\-T\-L. S\-T\-L files are described as vectors of \char`\"{}\-Triangles\char`\"{} }{\pageref{classkia_1_1Triangle}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classkia_1_1Vector3d}{kia\-::\-Vector3d} \\*The \char`\"{}\-Vector3d\char`\"{} class defines a simple 3d vector. This is really a glorified structure }{\pageref{classkia_1_1Vector3d}}{}
