As part of U\-S\-C's entry into the \char`\"{}\-Kuka Innovation Award\char`\"{} 2017, we need to develop a tool to improve the resolution of S\-T\-L files. Instead of adding more points as part of a smoothing algorithm, we found it necessary to simply ensure that each triangle face was smaller than a user defined minimum. This implies loading and parsing a binary S\-T\-L file and iterating through all the faces, checking to see if that face falls below some area threshold. If it does not, then we split that triangle into 4 smaller triangles (by placing a new vertex at the center of each existing edge) and recursively inspect them until all faces are smaller than the threshold.

Note that the absolute size of each face is not gauranteed, we simply ensure that face area is less than a minimum threshold.

Although this functionality is probably part of other libraries, such as the P\-C\-L, we find it useful to have it seperated into as a stand alone tool, limiting the linking complexity. Our subdivision library does not rely upon any but the standard C++ libraries (c++11) and is intended to perform this task alone.\hypertarget{index_Build}{}\section{Build}\label{index_Build}
This project is built with Make (rather than C\-Make) and can be built with the supplied Makefile.

It is assumed that the G\-C\-C (g++ 4.\-8.\-4) is being used to compile this library. G\-C\-C specific preprocessor macros are used.

This library was built specifically for Ubuntu Linux machines. Windows is N\-O\-T supported.\hypertarget{index_Install}{}\section{Install}\label{index_Install}
